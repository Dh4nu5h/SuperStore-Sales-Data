Superstore Sales Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Superstore Sales Data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about sales trends, product categories, and customer behavior using Python and data visualization techniques.

Dataset

Source: Superstore Dataset

File Type: CSV

Columns Analyzed: Sales, Category, Order Date, Ship Date, City, Region, and more

Tools & Libraries Used

Pandas - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

NumPy - Numerical Computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data Visualization

Data Cleaning Steps

Dropped unnecessary columns like Row ID, Order ID, Customer ID, etc.

Converted Order Date and Ship Date columns to datetime format

Removed city and region details for a broader analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis

Sales by Category - Identified the most sold product categories

Monthly Sales Trends - Analyzed sales distribution over time

Unique Cities Count - Found the number of unique cities

Data Visualization - Used histograms and bar charts to understand trends

Key Visualizations

Histogram of Product Categories - Showcased category-wise sales distribution

Monthly Sales Chart - Highlighted seasonal sales trends

Key Questions Answered

What are the most sold product categories?

How do sales vary across different months?

What is the impact of dropping city and region columns?

How to Run the Notebook

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially

Conclusion

This project provides an in-depth sales analysis using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The insights from this analysis can help businesses optimize their sales strategies and inventory management.
